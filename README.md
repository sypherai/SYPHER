    Port 80: CLOSED
    Port 443: OPEN
    ```

#### - **Network Analysis**
  - Provides simulated network data such as:
    - **Speed:** 100 Mbps
    - **Latency:** 23ms
    - **Packet Loss:** 0.1%

#### - **IP Lookup**
  - Simulates querying IP addresses and basic geolocation.
  - Example output:
    ```
    IP Address: 192.168.1.1
    Location: Unknown
    Status: Active
    ```

#### - **Hash Generator**
  - Converts user-inputted text into hash values using MD5-like hashing.
  - Example: `hello` â†’ `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`.

### 4. **Terminal Messaging System**
- Users can send messages through the terminal interface and receive simulated responses.
- Messages are displayed in real time, providing a simple interactive chat system.

### 5. **System Status Panel**
- Displays simulated system resource usage such as:
  - **CPU Usage:** 42%
  - **Memory Usage:** 2.4 GB
